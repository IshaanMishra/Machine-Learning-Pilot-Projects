An Assortment of ML Projects for Beginners to understand concepts and perform hands on through Jupyter Notebooks.

Understand the below concepts:
Data Visualization Techniques with Python
Data Analysis with Pandas Dataframe
Machine Learning Techniques with Python scikit Library

The objective is to interpret exploratory statistics and identify appropriate features and machine learning algorithms to use. 
Notebooks include stuff on Data Clustering, Predictive Analysis, Regression, Classification, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning.

Below are some mini projects with datasets you'll come across:
 Iris Flower Classification with Decision Trees – Support Vector Machine
 Clustering Volcano dataset according to eruption time - K-means
 Classification of Survived Passengers on Titanic Dataset – Perceptron
 Bag of Words Model using Pandas
